Mission goal
============

Do you have the feeling that such class have a quite identical structure?
You are right!!

The goal of this mission is to restructure the code by using the dataclass constructor:

here is an example of code
 import dataclasses
 from dataclasses import dataclass

 @dataclass
 class Question:
     question: str
     answers: list[str]
     solution: int =1

=======
This is equivalent to:

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question: str, answers: list[str], solution=1:int):
        self.question = question
        self.answers = answers
        self.solution = solution
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Question(question={self.question}, answers={self.answers}, solution={self.solution}

    __str__ = __repr__

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.question == other.question and self.answers == other.answers and self.solution == other.solution
