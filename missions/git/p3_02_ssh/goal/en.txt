Mission goal
============

Next step is to be able to communicate with the github repo via secure connection (ssh).
This step needs to be done only once for all your github repo.

We advise to use a dedicated ssh key for github (and a unique one for each server/machine used).
On the otherhand, we advised that you do not use a passphrase to avoid to type your password everytime.
(If you have an agent running, you can obviously put a passphrase).

Step 1: Generate a (new and local) ssh key.
===========================================
(bypass this step if you want to use an agent and a ssh key from your laptop/workstation/...)

For this run the following command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.git
and enter (twice) the passphrase of your choice (just type enter twice to not have any passphrase).


Step 2: tell github about the key you want to use.
=================================================
run
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.git.pub
and copy the output in your clipboard, then go to 
https://github.com/settings/keys
click on "New ssh key" put as title the name of the cluster
and paste the content of your clipboard.


Step 3: check the connection
============================
run gsh check to test the connection and/or run
ssh -T git@github.com
to see what the problem is.
