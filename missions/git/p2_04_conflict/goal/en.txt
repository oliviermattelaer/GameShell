INFO
====

If two divergent branch are both changing the same line of code. You will need to indicate how to proceed.
For that open the problematic file with your favorite text editor and search for lines like
>>>>>>
line that was included in the current branch

<<<<<

Then remove the ">>>>", the "====" and the "<<<<<" and adjust the code as needed.
