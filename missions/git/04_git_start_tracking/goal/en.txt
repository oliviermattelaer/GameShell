Mission goal
============

You are in the new Food Factory of the realm. (directory: World/Factory)
This Factory is already a git repository (you can check that it has a .git directory).

Currently the factory has only one file "welcome.txt".
But the change to this file is not tracked by git (you can check it by running "git status").

YOUR MISSION is to create a first release containing this file.


Useful commands
===============

git status
~~ check the status of the current git repository
~~ indicates  which file are edited, not tracked,...
~~ Note: it indicates commands that can be usefull.

git add FILE
~~ Add a file to the index
~~ Start to track a new file

git commit
~~ save the current index as a commit of the history
~~ usefull option:
~~  -m "MSG" : provide directly the commit message (MSG) without opening a text editor


HINT/HELP
=========

Remember the two required steps:
1) add the file to the index/staging area (git add command)
2) do the commit of the file in the staging area (git commit command)

If you do not know the status of your files. you can use "git status"
which typically tells you the command that you might need to use next.
