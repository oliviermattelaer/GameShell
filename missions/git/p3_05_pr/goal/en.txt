Mission goal
============

github is not only a place to share a common git repository
but also a place where you can collaborate.
The typical place for discussion on github is via issue and  Pull Request.
Pull Request allow you to discuss a proposed changed of code modification.

Your current mission is to propose to port back your change to the original github repo (the one that you clone from: https://github.com/oliviermattelaer/gitlectures).

For that go to your github repo.
then click on pull request and then on new pull request.

You will be able to choose which of your branch of your repo (in this case the master branch) you want to merge with which branch of your/another repository. (you can target the master branch).
