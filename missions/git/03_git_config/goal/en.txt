Mission goal
============

Provide information to git to identify yourself.
This include
  - Your name
  - Your email


Useful commands
===============

git config [--global] user.name "YOURNAME"
git config [--global] user.email "NAME.LASTNAME@uclouvain.be"
  Those command have to be run ONCE per project/machine.
  If run with the --global they need to be run only once per machine/cluster.
  Note that if you use the --global this will have impact outside the game
  and those configuration will be used for all your git repo on this cluster.
