Mission goal
============

Your promotion on the philosopher's stone had a hug impact. And the product is now sold out.
It's time to add that product in the file SOLDOUT_waiting_for_stock.list
Then publish it within your github repo.

This is the same as previous level BUT something "new" will happen since a collaborator (in this case an automatic script) has submit a new commit before you.

Usefull command
===============
git pull
    try to update your current repo and update your HEAD to the one of the
    remote repository

IF you have local commit this will break and you will need to use one of the following option:

git pull --rebase
    re-apply your local commit one by one on top of the commit on the remote repository. (give a linear history)

git pull --merge
    Do a standard merge operation.
