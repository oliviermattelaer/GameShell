Goal of the  mission
====================  


Good job! 
Now your goal is to be able to load an (old) version of Python.
Can you load a version of Python2?

Information
===========

Note that the program are organised into "releases" which related to the compiler of a given year.
Old program need to change this release to switch to an older one.
To switch release this is the same as for module: module load releases/XXXXXX
To know which releases is needed use module spider with the full name of the module that you want.

When the module is loaded, you can use gsh check (no question this time)

Useful commands
===============

module spider NAME
  list all possible version of the program containing NAME in their NAME
  
module spider NAME/VERSION
  gives the details on the other modules to be loaded to get access to that particular module

module load XXXXXX
ml XXXXXX
  loading the specify module / release
