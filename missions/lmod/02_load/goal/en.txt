Goal of the  mission
====================  

Now that you find the correct default version, you can ask the librarian to put that spell in your book of spell.
Such that you can launch such spell as well.

For this mission, Your goal is to activate the default version of the "python" spell.
To succeed the "gsh check" you will need to provide the place where such spell is store in the library 
(path of the executable). You can use the command 'which python' for that.  

Useful commands
===============

module av XXXXX
  list various currently available program containing name XXXXX
  a (D) indicates the default version.


module load NAME
  activating a given program (such that you can use the related commands)
   NAME  can just be the name (like module load Python) then it takes the default
         can be a name and a version number to load a dedicated version (like module load Python/3.12.1) 

which python 
   print the full path of the executable python command


Technical Information
=====================

In order to launch a program you need a couple of information including:
- Where the executable is
- where the dependencies are
Those information are typically store within environment variables ($PATH, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH,...).
The module will technically add/clean those environement variable, allowing you to have an easy way to
handle such variables.
