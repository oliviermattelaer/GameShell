Goal of the  mission
====================  


Good job! 
Do you know that "module av / module avail" does not show the full list of module/program that you can use.
They only show one section (named releases) of the full library. 
Careful, you can not have spells/programs from two different sections loaded in your spell book at the same time.

The goal of this mission is to find how many different versions of Python is available in the FULL library and not only in the current section (release) that you are in.

Useful commands
===============

module av NAME
  list various currently available program containing name NAME

module spider NAME
  list all possible versions of the program containing NAME in their NAME

  
module spider NAME/VERSION
  gives the details on the other modules to be loaded to get access to that particular module
