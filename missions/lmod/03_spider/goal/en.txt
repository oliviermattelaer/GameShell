Goal of the  mission
====================  


Good job! 
Do you know that "module av" does not show the full list of module/program that you can use.
Some module (typically named "releases") allow to access even more version of a given program.

Your goal here is to find how many different version of Python are available on the system.  

Useful commands
===============

module av NAME
  list various currently available program containing name NAME
  a (D) indicates the default version.

module spider NAME
  list all possible version of the program containing NAME in their NAME
  
module spider NAME/VERSION
  gives the details on the other modules to be loaded to get access to that particular module
