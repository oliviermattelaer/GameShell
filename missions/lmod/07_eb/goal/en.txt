Goal of the  mission
====================

If you do not have book/spell program in the library,
You can check if you can add it ... yourself.

The library has a simple way to add spell: Easybuild

To succeed this mission, you need to install a new version of VIM on the system

Instruction
===========

 1. Search what easybuild can install as version of VIM
    eb --search vim
    It will report a list of path with version that you can install

 2. From the name, you will see that vim depend on GCCcore, so check the current version of GCCcore (this depend on the release) 
    module av GCCcore/

 3. Select the path that you think is correct and check what you are going to install:
   eb PATH_TO_FILE -Dr 
   "-Dr" is for dry run
   a line starting with "- [ ]" is a for a dependence that will be installed
   a line starting with "- [x]" is a dependence already installed
  
   NOTE: If you have more than one "- [ ]" in this case, this means that you are using a wrong file for this tuto.  

 4. launch the installation:
   eb PATH_TO_FILE

 5. Wait one minute and you are done

 6. load the module with:
   module load use.own Vim
