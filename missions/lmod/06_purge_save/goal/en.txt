Goal of the  mission
====================  


In this mission the goal is to create your own collection of spell.
Such that you can activate multiple spell with a name of your choice.

Do a collection with the following module:
    R/4.2.2-foss-2022b
    netCDF/4.9.0-gompi-2022b
    Java/11.0.20
and name it VESUVE.
