Goal of the  mission
====================

The library is not large enough for you!

You have started to create your own spell and you realise that it would be great
to organise your self a bit in order to keep all those spell organised and easy to use.
In short you want to have your own library.

Your mission is to create a module for your script:
thx_1138.sh
that you have install in the following directory:
./Movies/gl_1971/
and that requires:
 
 1. python3.10 to run
 2. an update on an environment variable PYTHONPATH to include ./Movies/lib/site-package/python3.10


Useful Information
==================

 1. You can use ``module show XXXX`` to show the syntax of other module such that you can have template.
 
 2. You can store your module in .local/modules (the module to activate those is module load use.own)
 
 3. The recommended method is to create a directory with the name of the program (here THX) and within that directory create a file with the number version as name and extension ".lua". So the file to create is 
  '~/.local/modules/THX/1138.lua' 

CONTENT OF THE FILE
===================
 
  - conflict("NAME")
    This line is not mandatory, but indicates that you need first to unload any module the name NAME.
    It is quite typical to put any module with the same name in conflict so here ``conflict("THX")``
  
  - prepend_path("NAME","VALUE")
    Update the environment variable NAME to add an additional path 
    Here you need to update PATH and PYTHONPATH

  - load("NAME")
    Indicate that you need first to load the module "NAME"
    Here you need to indicate that you need to load PYTHON3.10 (and the associated release)
