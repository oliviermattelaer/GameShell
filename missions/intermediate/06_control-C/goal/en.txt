Mission goal
============

The king's pyrotechnician is trying to remember the magical incantation 
for creating the grand finale for his fireworks. This incantation starts 
with the work $command and must be followed by four random letters, as 
in

  $ $command abcd
or
  $ $command oops

Help the pyrotechnician by finding 4 letters producing appropriate 
fireworks.


NOTE: when the four letters are incorrect, the magical reaction 
can take a very long time. You need to interrupt it!

It will probably take several tries before finding a combination 
of letters that works.


Useful commands
===============

$command CCCC
  This (non standard) command creates some fireworks:
    - if the four letters are valid, the fireworks will start after a few 
      seconds,
    - if the four letters are not valid, the whole magical reaction will go 
      on for a long time.

Control-c       (also written ^c)
  Pressing Control and c at the same times interrupts the current command 
  by sending the INT ("INTerrupt") signal to the process.
