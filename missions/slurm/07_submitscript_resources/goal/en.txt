Mission goal
============

Although an empty submission script is technically a valid submission script is most cases, it is not useful as is. There are two main section that are needed in the submission script.

The first one is the description of the resources that your job will require. The most important resources to specify are

- the needed number of CPUs ;
- the required amount of memory.

You also need to specify how long the job will need those resources. Remember that there is a limit on the maximum duration of a job! 

To specify a resource, you must include lines in the submission scripts, that start with #SBATCH and then the parameter name, followed by an optional equal sign and its value.

Exemple:

#SBATCH --time=10:00

There are unfortunately no magic solution to find out the correct amount of resources and duration for a given job as it will depend on many factors. Only experience will tell you what amount of resource to request for a given job.

To fullfill this mission, insert in the submission script the three require lines to specify that the job should run for 10 minutes using 4 CPUs and 1000MB of RAM per CPU.

Useful parameters
=================

--time
Specify the maximum duration of the job. It is expressed as days, hours, minutes and second in the format  d-hh:mm:ss but can be simplified as hh:mm

--cpus-per-task
Number of CPUs required by the job. For now, we will ignore the word 'task' in the parameter name. We'll come back at this later.

--mem-per-cpu
Amount of memory, in MB, that are required for each CPU to work properly.
