Information
============

An address can be stored in a variable.
Since C is strongly typed, you have a different syntax for pointer pointing to different type of variable. For example:
int i  //this is a variable named i which is an integer
int* p_i //this is a variable named p_i which contains an adress to an integer

while for float you will have
float var
float* p_var

So you only have to add a * after the type.


Goal of the mission
===================

edit the file address.c
define a pointer to a given variable
and  print the value stored at the address stored in that pointer

Useful commands
===============

&a: return the address of the variable "a"

*p: return the value store at the address of the  pointer "p"
