Mission goal
============

Your goal is to be able to modify a variable within a function.
A starting point function is avaible as multiplication.c

The function print_table should automatically update the variable containing the table to print such that two successive call to the function will print two different table.



Useful commands/concept:
========================

int* p_a; : create a pointer (for an integer)
int a = *p_a  : initialise an integer with the value stored at a given address
&a : adress of the variable a 
*p_a =   : change the value stored at a given address


Remember that argument of a function can not be changed.
