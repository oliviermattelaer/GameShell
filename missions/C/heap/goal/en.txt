Useful commands/concept:
========================

Having fix sized array can put quite constraint on your memory consumption, forcing you to create too long array 'just in case'...

Dynamical memory allows you to fix that:
Here is the syntax:
int* vector = malloc(size * sizeof(int));
 
malloc is the function that give you the memory
as argument you need to provide the amount of memory needed
as output, it returns a pointer/array.


Mission goal
============

read the code dynamical_libray.c
and compile it
