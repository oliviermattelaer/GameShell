New Concept: Array
==================

As a first (basic) data structure, we have an ordered list of integer/float/character/....
This is called an array

To define an array, you need to know its size, 
here is a series of valid syntax:
int array_i[5]; 
int array_i[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int array_i[] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 

This also allow to handle string (has an array of character) which have a nice way to initialise them:
char greeting[] = "hello";

You can access/change each element independently via their index (this is an example for fibonacci sequence)
array_i[2] = array_i[1]+array_i[0];

Note that first element has index 0!

Mission goal
============

just type "gsh check"
