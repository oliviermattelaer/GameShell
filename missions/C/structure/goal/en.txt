Useful commands/concept:
========================

You can create your own data-structure with syntax.
struct Formation {
   char  title[50];
   char  speaker[50];
   int   nb_student;
 };

which allow to define one object of type Formation
struct Formation myformation;
which can either be initialised like
struct Formation myformation = {"C", "Olivier", 28}
or element by element (note the special handling for string)
myformation.nb_student = 20;
strcopy(myformation.title, "C");

Mission goal
============

Update the file structure.tex to have a correct initialization and printing of one structure.

Basic of pointer:
=================

int* p_a; : create a pointer (for an integer)
%a : adress of the variable a 
*p_a =   : change the value stored at a given address
