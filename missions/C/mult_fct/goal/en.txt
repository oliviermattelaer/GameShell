Mission goal
============


Your goal is to refactor the code such that you are using one function to print one multiplication table.

For this level your main script you should not touch the main function but just define the required function.




Useful commands:
===============

FUNCTION
--------
returnType functionName(type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2, type3 parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
