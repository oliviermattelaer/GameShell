Mission goal
============

Your goal is to keep the same output. But instead of using a while loop, use the much cleaner "for" loop construct of C.


Useful commands:
===============

for(INIT; CONDITION; UPDATE) {...}
   When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:

   INIT: 
      is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
      example: int i=0
   CONDITION:
      defines the condition for executing the code block.
      example: i<100
   UPDATE:
      is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
      example: i++;
