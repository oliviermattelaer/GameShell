Useful commands/concept:
========================

You can also use pointer to structure.
As for other type you just need to add a *

Note if you have a pointer to a structure you can access to a value via the -> operator:

example:
struct Formation* Myformation;
... (initialization /...)
nb_student = Myformation->nb_student;


Mission goal
============

Refactor your previous code to define a function to do the printout. But this time pass a pointer to the structure.
