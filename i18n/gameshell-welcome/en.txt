Welcome to GitShell!

This game is inspired by GameShell which was designed for learning Unix command.

In this game, you will learn how to manage a git repository (like track file, undo mistake, find bug, ...)
This game is designed to be complementary to a lecture on git and is NOT designed to work in standalone.
