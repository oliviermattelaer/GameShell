Welcome to GameShell (module version)!

In the previous game (bash/shell), you have learned the way to move in a castle,
to edit files, to find/clear files, ...
For that you have learned many command (cd, ls, find, grep).

Now all commands are not directly available for you, like for example the one sending
a burning torch towards a Python, or the one for doing abinitio alchemy.

Those commands you need to find them first and then activate them.
The reason is that multiple person might not want the exact same version of such command and
that they might not be compatible with each other (and that you have dependency).

The purpose of this game is to teach you, how to find the verstion of a command/code that you want to use.
